- dir(module) = lists all symbols in the module
- help(module) = built-in help on module
- help(module.function) = built-in help on function in module
- Using a comma with `print` inserts a space between the items, but using a plus sign concatenates them.  
- Python strings are immutable
- The `-tt` flag for python causes it to halt if it ever encounters a mixture of tab characters and spaces.
- The elements of a list do not have to be of the same type.
- To make a copy of a list, use the syntax `listOne = listTwo[:]`
- To loop over a list, use the syntax `for var in listOne: print var`
- To test if a value is in a list (or other data structure), use the syntax `value in listOne`
- `listOne.append(value)` does not return any value, it modifies the original list
- `del varOne` removes the definition of a variable, but not necessarily the object itself (i.e., if `varOne` and `varTwo` point to the same object and you `del varOne`, the object and `varTwo` will remain in tact)
- A list can grow/shrink in size and can otherwise be modified; a tuple has a fixed length and is immutable.
- Dictionaries can retrieve by a key in constant time (O(1)).
- If you put a trailing comma at the end of a print statement, it will suppress the newline character that is normally added.
- Calling .split() without arguments will split on whitespaces
- re.search(pat, text) return a Match type object
- match.group() returns the matching text that was found; if there's no match found then match will point to the 'None' built-in
- the entire pattern must be found in the text for it to count as a match
- The search will go left to right and will stop after the first match
- def Find(pat, text):
  - match = re.search(pat, text)
  - if match: print match.group()
  - else: print 'not found'
- regular expression basic patterns
  - period (.) matches any single character except newline
  - \w matches any "word" character: a letter or digit or underscore [a-zA-Z0-9_]
  - \W matches any non-"word" character
  - \d matches any decimal digit [0-9]
  - \s matches a single whitespace character: space, newline, return, tab, form [ \n\r\t\f]
  - \S matches any non-whitespace character
  - + matches 1 or more of the pattern
  - * matches 0 or more of the pattern
- Python has an option for a raw string -- putting a lowercase r before a string tells Python not to do any special processing with backslashes in the string.
